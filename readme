wbmDaemon is a fledgling tool for wrapping multiple instances of WBM to create pools of simulations primarily for parameter uncertainty exploration.

The tool is fairly undeveloped and could stand to be made more generalizeable, with a more abstracted way of controlling customization.  Right now, new applications have needed to build on the core functionality.  That suggests to me (SZ) that a core kernel of functionality for this utility hasn't quite been achieved yet to start building around.

This repo provides different project specific examples ofthe tool functionality.

One is a manual exploration of parameter sensitivities. There were many upstream simulation bases (from upstream models - see Zuidema et al. In Review with PNAS, 2023), so there is some precedent for handling a suite of pre-canned upstream inputs.  From there, wbmDaemon adds in WBM parametric sensitivity to the suite of simulations and handles pooled model execution.

Two is a wrapper package around the python utility SpotPy for hydrologic model parameter uncertainty exploration.
